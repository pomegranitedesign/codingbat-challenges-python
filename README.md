# Coding-Bat Python challenges 
```Repository with all CodingBat challenges for Python```

I decided to create this repository to keep tracking of my Python skills as well as tracking the progress of my programming experience in terms of thinking and solving the problems on my own. I would love to practice it with Python due to its easily readable syntax and highhly accessible sources even though I could've done it with JS or C++.
